## R Package: `kctools`
The `kctools` package contains a suite of helper functions that I've written to address data manipulation and analysis tasks I frequently encounter in my work. I have turned this into an R package for myself and for those who would be interested in incorporating them in their workflow. The package includes functions for:
- Creating a data frame of summary statistics
- Constructing a data frame of one-way and two-way tabulations of counts and proportions
- Generating indicators of duplicated observations in a dataset
- Producing a data frame with pairwise distances of two `sf` objects     

You can find the [latest version](https://github.com/kennchua/kctools) of `kctools` in my Github. To install:
```r
devtools::install_github("kennchua/kctools")
```
